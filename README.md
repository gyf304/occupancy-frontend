# Occupancy Frontend

A part of CMU Library Occupancy project. A responsive web frontend.

## Configuration

Configuration is at `js/config.js`. The most important parameter is `occupancy.config.server`. Other parameters are mostly cosmetic: feel free to change them.

## Server Setup

The frontend is static, simply host the repository somewhere on the web. You can also run this locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.
